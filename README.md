This project was created as a tool for lecturing in Introduction to Soil Mechanics. Lectures that was part of a voluntary action called "Solidarity Courses in Civil Engineering" at the department of Civil Engineering(AUTH). The purpose of the project is to show the influence of each parameter in the whole system. So the problem is parametrized and the parameter values can be changed with sliders. Also, another element that is visualized is the failure envelope and the the failure itself (by changing some colors) so that the limit of stress can be understood by the students.

It is my first project in Java. You can see pictures below.
